###Evaluating the performance of each model
#Which model has a lower loss?
  Closing data model has a loss of .006(.6%), FNG data model has a loss of .06(6%). Closing data has the lower loss
  
#Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
  The closing data model clearly outperforms in tracking the actual closing prices over time.

#Which window size works best for the model?
  I used 10 for window size
  
Closing data clearly performs better than FNG, however FNG data could offer insights towards other indicators such as incoming volatility and periods of cooling off.
